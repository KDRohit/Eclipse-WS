1- java.io.Closeable is an interface 
	- does not mean it will automatically close itself.
	- Closeable is just a contract (class promises to provide a close() method that releases 					its resources)

	-You (or some framework) must explicitly call close()

2-When it can auto-close

	-A Closeable or AutoCloseable object can be auto-closed only if you use it in a try-with-	  resources block:
	
		try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)) 
		{
   	 		String input = sc.nextLine();
    			System.out.println(input);
		} 	
		// <- sc.close() is automatically called here

3- Examples of Closeable classes
		
	1-java.io.InputStream and its subclasses (e.g., FileInputStream)
	2-java.io.OutputStream and its subclasses
	3-java.io.Reader / java.io.Writer
	4-java.util.Scanner
	5-Many JDBC classes (Connection, ResultSet, Statement â€” these actually implement					AutoCloseable)
